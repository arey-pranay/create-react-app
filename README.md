# create-react-app
Tried to simplify all the things that usually overwhelm people starting out with react. Tried to explain the folder structures, the significance and meaning of different files, and some extra points that might be just good-to-know for beginners. In short, I just tried to compile the information I had when I first created react app. I hope it helps.
